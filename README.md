# Recipe search

## Initial details:
In this exercise we are going to create a program that allows for searching for recipes based on their name, cooking time, or the name of an ingredient. The program should read the recipes from a file that the user provides. It might be a good idea to brush up on reading information from files (part 4) before beginning

Each recipe consists of three or more rows in a recipe file. The first row is for the name of the recipe, the second the cooking time (an integer), and the third and possibly following rows list the ingredients used in the recipe. An empty row follows the last ingredient row. There can be many recipes in a single file. Below, an example file containing recipes is described.

## Part 1: Reading and listing recipes
First create the functionality to read and list recipes. The user interface of the program is described below. You may assume that the user only enters files that exist. Below we assume that the example recipes given earlier in the exercise description are stored in the file recipes.txt.

    File to read: recipes.txt
    
    Commands:
    list - lists the recipes
    stop - stops the program
    
    Enter command: list
    
    Recipes:
    Pancake dough, cooking time: 60
    Meatballs, cooking time: 20
    Tofu rolls, cooking time: 30
    
    Enter command:  stop

## Part 2: Finding recipes by name
Make it possible to find recipes by their names. Finding by name is done with the command find name, after which the user is asked for the name that is used to search. The search should print all the recipes whose names contain the string given by the user.

    File to read: recipes.txt
    
    Commands:
    list - lists the recipes
    stop - stops the program
    find name - searches recipes by name
    
    Enter command: list
    
    Recipes:
    Pancake dough, cooking time: 60
    Meatballs, cooking time: 20
    Tofu rolls, cooking time: 30
    
    Enter command: find name
    Searched word: roll
    
    Recipes:
    Tofu rolls, cooking time: 30
    
    Enter command:  stop

## Part 3: Searching for recipes by cooking time
Next, implement the possibility to find recipes based on their cooking time. This is done with the command find cooking time, after which the user is asked for the longest acceptable cooking time. The program should react by printing all the recipes whose cooking times don't exceed the cooking time given by the user (so equal or less time).

    File to read: recipes.txt
    
    Commands:
    list - lists the recipes
    stop - stops the program
    find name - searches recipes by name
    find cooking time - searches recipes by cooking time
    
    Enter command: find cooking time
    Max cooking time: 30
    
    Recipes:
    Meatballs, cooking time: 20
    Tofu rolls, cooking time: 30
    
    Enter command: find cooking time
    Max cooking time: 15
    
    Recipes:
    
    Enter command: find name
    Searched word: roll
    
    Recipes:
    Tofu rolls, cooking time: 30
    
    Enter command:  stop
    
## Part 4: Finding recipes based on their ingredients
Finally, add the functionality to search for recipes based on their ingredients. This is done by choosing the command find ingredient, after which the user is asked for a string. The program should then print all the recipes that contain the specified string. Notice that with this option the given string must match exactly the ingredient that is searched for (e.g. "ugar" will return different results than "sugar").

    File to read: recipes.txt
    
    Commands:
    list - lists the recipes
    stop - stops the program
    find name - searches recipes by name
    find cooking time - searches recipes by cooking time
    find ingredient - searches recipes by ingredient
    
    Enter command: find cooking time
    Max cooking time: 30
    
    Recipes:
    Meatballs, cooking time: 20
    Tofu rolls, cooking time: 30
    
    Enter command: find ingredient
    Ingredient: sugar
    
    Recipes:
    Pancake dough, cooking time: 60
    
    Enter command: find ingredient
    Ingredient: egg
    
    Recipes:
    Pancake dough, cooking time: 60
    Meatballs, cooking time: 20
    
    Enter command: find ingredient
    Ingredient: gg
    
    Recipes:
    
    Enter command:  stop
